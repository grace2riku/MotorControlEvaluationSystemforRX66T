## Hardware Preparation (General)
 - Refer to RXxxx/clock_profile.hpp for the crystal frequency of each microcontroller and each module.
 - Connect the indicator LEDs to the specified ports.
 - The LEDs are connected so that they light up at the LOW level output by default.
 - By changing the typedef of the LED, it can be made to turn on at the HIGH level.
   
```C++
/// LED connection port definition
/// LED_ACTIVE = 0 when the LED is to be turned on with "Inhale: Output 0
/// LED_ACTIVE = 1 if the LED is to be turned on at output 1
/// Memo:
// Port outputs have different capabilities when current is drawn (suction) and when current is swept (discharge).
// In general, "sucking in" often allows more current to flow, and it is customary to follow that convention and connect with "sucking in".

- For BlueBoard-RX62N_100pin,  use the red LED (D2) on the board.
- For FRK-RX62N, use LED1 on the board. (yellow) 
- For GR-CITRUS, use the red LED1 on the board.  (red) 
- For RX65N Envision kit, use the blue LED on the board.
- For RX72N Envision kit, use the blue LED on the board.

## Boost the master clock
- Boost the internal instruction clock (ICLK) to maximum speed once the operation is transferred to the main function.
- Also set the clock for the internal device. (The setting is in RXxxx/clock_profile.hpp)

```C++
    SYSTEM_IO::boost_master_clock();
```

---

## Set LED connection port to "output".

```C++
	LED::OUTPUT(); // set LED port to output
```

## Blink.

```C++
	while(1) {
		utils::delay::milli_second(250);
		LED::P = 1; // lights on
		utils::delay::milli_second(250);
		LED::P = 0; // lights off
	}
````

## Limiting resistors for LEDs

- Refer to the table below for the value of the limiting resistor to be placed in series with the LEDs.
- The limiting resistor can be either on the Vcc side or on the Vss (GND) side.

When a current of about 1mA is applied:
|Supply voltage|Red(Vf)|Yellow(Vf)|Blue(Vf)|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|3.3V|2K (1.4V)|1.2K (2.1V)|300 (3.0V)|
|5V|3.6K (1.4V)|3K (2.1V)|2K (3.0V)|

Calculation Formula:
  ("Supply voltage" - "Vf of LED") / "Current to LED"   

- The Vf of the LEDs in the table is only a guide and varies depending on the current flowing to the LEDs and the LEDs.
- When Vf is large, the limiting resistor becomes smaller, so be sure that the current flowing through the port does not exceed the limit.
- For the maximum current that can flow through the port, refer to "Electrical Characteristics" and "Allowable Output Current" in the hardware manual.

## How to build

- Move to each platform directory and make.
- Write led_sample.mot file to the microcontroller.
- FRK-RX62N is R5F562N7 (FlashRom: 374KB), so change the device in Makefile.
- Enable the CQ_FRK variable (compile-time constant) to switch the board dependence.

---
   
## Operation
- The LED flashes every 0.25 seconds.
    
## Remarks
- This project is basic and includes minimum settings etc. Please refer to it when starting a new project.
